# Project 1 - Lawffice website

## Legal Services

- What was your motivation?

When we started brainstorming for this project, Jordan asked if we wanted to create a front-end application for her mother's legal practice.
We thought it would be a great, real-world example to code so we went started designing and planning. Ms. Barringer wanted a clean website that emphasized client interaction and provided a list of the services she offers. That being said, there are some parts of this build that act as placeholders for later builds (like the lawyer videos and generic client reviews). In the future, our team can come back to this project and properly implement some of the features that we originally planned to include, like a Google Maps API and a document submisison form, which would allow Ms. Barringer's clients to upload important documents straight to her dropbox.


- What problem does it solve?

Our client, Ms. Barringer, has thought about pursuing a career as a personal attorney seperate from her current law firm. The web application we created allows her to begin her new career on the right foot -- with a solid digital foundation and plenty of functionality to assist her new practice as it continues to grow.
